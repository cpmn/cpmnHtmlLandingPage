**Author:** Claudia Paola Muñoz  
**Role:** QA Specialist • Automation Engineer • Problem Solver

with a subtle Star Trek–inspired ethos guiding the design.

## 🚀 About This Project

The goal of this site is simple:

- Present my work and experience in a clear, human-centered way  
- Communicate my philosophy of engineering: logic, reliability, curiosity  
- Provide a modern interface where people can explore my story, skills, and projects  
- Add personality through subtle sci-fi elements — without losing professionalism  

The design emphasizes clarity, accessibility, and a sense of thoughtful structure, much like the systems I help teams build.
